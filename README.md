# Adidas Responsive Web Layout

Designed and developed a fully responsive layout for Adidas, ensuring seamless adaptability across mobile and desktop devices. Implemented dynamic layout adjustments to optimize user experience on different screen sizes. This project showcases expertise in front-end development, responsive design, and real-world problem-solving.
I also made a few changes to the layout as the client wanted to make some changes to the design later on, which I included.
